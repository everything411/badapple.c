Bad_Apple(ascii) player in C.

Requirements

1.gzip to uncompress bad_apple.txt.gz.

2.mpg123 to play mp3 file.

3.cc to compile.

You should uncompress bad_apple.txt.gz first,or the program exits immediately.

You may need to change USTODELAY in player(2).c to make the time per picture more accurate.

Frame per second:30.(Delay should be a little less than 33333us)

Best wishes for you.
